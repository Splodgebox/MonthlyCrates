# MonthlyCrates

MonthlyCrates is an easy to use loot crate system with a custom animation replicated the 'Cosmic Crate' feature on a server.

Create your own crates without any hassle or difficulty like you would find with other plugins. Along with this, you can have the ability to semi customise the animation using the YAML files, or you can fully recode your own animation using the Open Source repository on Github.
